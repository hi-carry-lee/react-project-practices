# Project Structure Guide

This monorepo contains multiple projects under the [projects/](mdc:projects) directory. These are all JS fullstack projects, some of them will use Typescript.

- [projects/1-mern-crash/](mdc:projects/1-mern-crash): A MERN stack project with separate frontend (React) and backend (Node.js/Express) codebases.
- [projects/2-chat-app/](mdc:projects/2-chat-app): A chat application with its own frontend (React) and backend (Node.js/Express) structure.


Top-level files like [package.json](mdc:package.json) and [pnpm-workspace.yaml](mdc:pnpm-workspace.yaml) manage dependencies and workspace configuration for the monorepo.
