# Frontend Development Guidelines

## Project Structure
Each frontend project typically follows this structure:
- `src/` - Source code directory
  - `components/` - Reusable React components
  - `pages/` - Page components
  - `context/` - React context providers
  - `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
  - `utils/` - Utility functions
  - `styles/` - CSS/SCSS files
  - `assets/` - Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)

## Component Guidelines
1. Use functional components with hooks
2. Follow the single responsibility principle
3. Keep components small and focused
4. Use proper prop typing
5. Implement error boundaries for critical components

## State Management
1. Use React Context for global state
2. Implement custom hooks for reusable state logic
3. Consider using Redux for complex state management
4. Keep state as local as possible

## Styling
1. Use CSS modules or styled-components
2. Follow BEM naming convention
3. Implement responsive design
4. Use CSS variables for theming

## Best Practices
1. Implement proper error handling
2. Add loading states
3. Use proper form validation
4. Implement proper TypeScript types
5. Write unit tests for critical components
